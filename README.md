# JU-WMiI

This repository stores various tasks for the c++ language that I happened to meet while studying in JU on the first semester. 

With all my desire, I can't show the essence of the tasks themselves (I am in doubt about the legality of the disclosure of such information). 
Thank you for your understanding!
